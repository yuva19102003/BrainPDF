{"content":"NIST CSWP 29\nThe NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0\nFebruary 26, 2024\n3\n2. Introduction to the CSF Core\nAppendix A is the CSF Core — a set of cybersecurity outcomes arranged by Function, then\nCategory, and finally Subcategory, as depicted in Fig. 1. These outcomes are not a checklist of\nactions to perform; specific actions taken to achieve an outcome will vary by organization and\nuse case, as will the individual responsible for those actions. Additionally, the order and size of\nFunctions, Categories, and Subcategories in the Core does not imply the sequence or\nimportance of achieving them. The structure of the Core is intended to resonate most with\nthose charged with operationalizing risk management within an organization.\nFig. 1. CSF Core structure\nThe CSF Core Functions — GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER — organize\ncybersecurity outcomes at their highest level.\n•\nGOVERN (GV) — The organization’s cybersecurity risk management strategy,\nexpectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored. The GOVERN\nFunction provides outcomes to inform what an organization may do to achieve and\nprioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and\nstakeholder expectations. Governance activities are critical for incorporating\ncybersecurity into an organization’s broader enterprise risk management (ERM)\nstrategy. GOVERN addresses an understanding of organizational context; the\nestablishment of cybersecurity strategy and cybersecurity supply chain risk\nmanagement; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policy; and the oversight of\ncybersecurity strategy.\n•\nIDENTIFY (ID) — The organization’s current cybersecurity risks are understood.\nUnderstanding the organization’s assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems,\nfacilities, services, people), suppliers, and related cybersecurity risks enables an\norganization to prioritize its efforts consistent with its risk management strategy and the\nmission needs identified under GOVERN. This Function also includes the identification of\nNIST CSWP 29\nThe NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0\nFebruary 26, 2024\n4\nimprovement opportunities for the organization’s policies, plans, processes, procedures,\nand practices that support cybersecurity risk management to inform efforts under all six\nFunctions.\n•\nPROTECT (PR) — Safeguards to manage the organization’s cybersecurity risks are used.\nOnce assets and risks are identified and prioritized, PROTECT supports the ability to\nsecure those assets to prevent or lower the likelihood and impact of adverse\ncybersecurity events, as well as to increase the likelihood and impact of taking\nadvantage of opportunities. Outcomes covered by this Function include identity\nmanagement, authentication, and access control; awareness and training; data security;\nplatform security (i.e., securing the hardware, software, and services of physical and\nvirtual platforms); and the resilience of technology infrastructure.\n•\nDETECT (DE) — Possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed.\nDETECT enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of\ncompromise, and other potentially adverse events that may indicate that cybersecurity\nattacks and incidents are occurring. This Function supports successful incident response\nand recovery activities.\n•\nRESPOND (RS) — Actions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken. RESPOND\nsupports the ability to contain the effects of cybersecurity incidents. Outcomes within\nthis Function cover incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and\ncommunication.\n•\nRECOVER (RC) — Assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored.\nRECOVER supports the timely restoration of normal operations to reduce the effects of\ncybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication during recovery efforts.\nFigure 2 shows the CSF Functions as a wheel because all of the Functions relate to one another.\nFor example, an organization will categorize assets under IDENTIFY and take steps to secure\nthose assets under PROTECT. Investments in planning and testing in the GOVERN and IDENTIFY\nFunctions will support timely detection of unexpected events in the DETECT Function, as well as\nenabling incident response and recovery actions for cybersecurity incidents in the RESPOND and\nRECOVER Functions. GOVERN is in the center of the wheel because it informs how an organization\nwill implement the other five Functions.\nWhile many cybersecurity risk management activities focus on preventing negative events\nfrom occurring, they may also support taking advantage of positive opportunities. Actions to\nreduce cybersecurity risk might benefit an organization in other ways, like increasing\nrevenue (e.g., first offering excess facility space to a commercial hosting provider for hosting\ntheir own and other organizations’ data centers, then moving a major financial system from\nthe organization’s in-house data center to the hosting provider to reduce cybersecurity\nrisks).\nNIST CSWP 29\nThe NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0\nFebruary 26, 2024\n5\nFig. 2. CSF Functions\nThe Functions should be addressed concurrently. Actions that support GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT,\nand DETECT should all happen continuously, and actions that support RESPOND and RECOVER\nshould be ready at all times and happen when cybersecurity incidents occur. All Functions have\nvital roles related to cybersecurity incidents. GOVERN, IDENTIFY, and PROTECT outcomes help\nprevent and prepare for incidents, while GOVERN, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER outcomes help\ndiscover and manage incidents.\nEach Function is named after a verb that summarizes its contents. Each Function is divided into\nCategories, which are related cybersecurity outcomes that collectively comprise the Function.\nSubcategories further divide each Category into more specific outcomes of technical and\nmanagement activities. The Subcategories are not exhaustive, but they describe detailed\noutcomes that support each Category.\nThe Functions, Categories, and Subcategories apply to all ICT used by an organization, including\ninformation technology (IT), the Internet of Things (IoT), and operational technology (OT). They\nalso apply to all types of technology environments, including cloud, mobile, and artificial\nintelligence systems. The CSF Core is forward-looking and intended to apply to future changes\nin technologies and environments."}

now the thing is when the main api sends an post request to endpoint 1, it will send an json reponse.
so in main api, after getting the reponse from endpoint 1, it should give an message [data extracted from pdf successfully], and send that json reponse to endpoint 2, that will give an json response, that will saved as a json file
then the main api will send the uid and json path as a response to frontend
