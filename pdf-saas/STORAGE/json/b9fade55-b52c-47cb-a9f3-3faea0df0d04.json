  "summary": "The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, released in February 2024, is a flexible, voluntary framework designed to help organizations of all sizes and sectors manage cybersecurity risks. It comprises the CSF Core (a taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes organized into Functions, Categories, and Subcategories), Organizational Profiles (for describing current or target cybersecurity posture), and Tiers (to characterize the rigor of risk governance). The CSF defines desirable outcomes but does not prescribe specific implementation methods, instead leveraging a suite of online resources for detailed guidance. It enables organizations to understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate cybersecurity risks globally.",
  "key_points": [
    "NIST CSF 2.0 is a flexible framework for managing cybersecurity risks, applicable to all organization types and sizes globally, regardless of maturity level.",
    "The CSF includes three main components: the CSF Core (a taxonomy of outcomes organized into Functions, Categories, and Subcategories), CSF Organizational Profiles (to describe current/target cybersecurity posture), and CSF Tiers (to characterize risk governance rigor).",
    "The CSF outlines desirable cybersecurity outcomes but does not prescribe specific methods or controls for achieving them; detailed guidance is provided through online resources.",
    "Complementary online resources include Informative References, Implementation Examples, Quick-Start Guides, Community Profiles, and Organizational Profile Templates.",
    "Organizations use the CSF to understand and assess, prioritize, and communicate cybersecurity risks.",
    "The CSF Core is structured around six high-level Functions: GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER.",
    "The GOVERN Function establishes the organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy and integrates cybersecurity into broader enterprise risk management (ERM).",
    "The IDENTIFY Function focuses on understanding current cybersecurity risks, including an organization's assets, suppliers, and related risks."
